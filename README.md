# SnakeGame

In this project, snake game built using java and GUI made by using java swing library.The player can control the snake with the arrow keys and eat food as it grows on the screen. We’ll start by creating a new project from scratch, then create and draw our user interface elements. Finally, we’ll add some event handlers and update the graphics when the player interacts with them.
